# Sentiment-Analysis
NLP

Abstract-

We explore the fusion of sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to enhance understanding of textual data. By leveraging a transformer-based model, our approach integrates sentiment polarity and fine-grained emotion detection. The model is trained on a custom-labeled dataset and evaluated against baselines. Results indicate improved accuracy, particularly in cases where sentiment and emotion overlap, providing deeper insights into textual nuances.

Introduction-

Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis are critical in natural language processing (NLP), with applications in customer feedback analysis, mental health monitoring, and social media understanding. While sentiment analysis determines polarity (positive, negative, neutral), emotion recognition identifies specific emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger).
Our work proposes a unified framework that combines these tasks to achieve richer, context-aware insights. The core hypothesis is that integrating sentiment polarity with granular emotions can enhance classification accuracy.
